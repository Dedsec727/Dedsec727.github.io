## 1) WPF: Window vs Page vs UserControl 

* **Window** is used when creating `dialog` based applications
* **Page** is used when creating `navigation` based applications
* **UserControl** is a `reusable user-created component` which can be used in multiple windows in any type of application

## 2) WPF: Change Start up Window 

Change `App.xaml -> <Application.StartupUri>`

## 3) WPF: Aligning the base line of a Label and its TextBox

Let's say I have a simple TextBox next to a Label:

{% highlight c# %}
<StackPanel>
    <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
        <Label Margin="3">MyLabel</Label>
        <TextBox Margin="3" Width="100">MyText</TextBox>
    </StackPanel>
    ...
</StackPanel>
{% endhighlight %}

This yields the following result:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/wpf/lbl-txtbox-baseline-align-unfixed.png)

As you can see, the base lines of MyLabel and MyText are not aligned, which looks ugly.

This behaviour is caused by the fact that the TextBox defaults to a vertical alignment of Stretch, which causes it to fill the available space and have the extra couple of pixels under the text.
Use this instead:

{% highlight c# %}
<StackPanel>
    <StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">
        <Label >MyLabel</Label>
        <TextBox VerticalAlignment="Center" Width="100">MyText</TextBox>
    </StackPanel>
</StackPanel>
{% endhighlight %}

which yields:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/wpf/lbl-txtbox-baseline-align-fixed.png)

## Get Windows user's Documents Path

You should use `Environment.GetFolderPath()` for getting environment folders. In particular, use `Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments)`, which will give you the "My Documents" folder for the user that the application is running under.

For more Special Folders, refer to: [Environment.SpecialFolder Enum](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.specialfolder?view=netframework-4.8){:target="_blank"}

## 4) C#: Saving a file and automatically create directories

Use `new FileInfo(path).Directory.Create()`

This creates anything in the hierarchy that's required. If the directory already exists it does nothing.

## 5) WPF: Run as Administrator

* Right click on your WPF project -> Add File
* Select Manifest File & name it `app.manifest`
* Change the `requestedExecutionLevel` from `asInvoker` to `requireAdministrator`
* Open the properties of your Project -> Application Tab -> Select the manifest file created above
  
## 6) C#: Repeat a character n times

{% highlight c# %} string tabs = new String('\t', n); {% endhighlight %}

(to be continued...)
