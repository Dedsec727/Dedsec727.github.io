# Early C++

## C with classes(1979)

* classes
* Member Functions
* Derived Classes
* Separate Compilation
* Public and Private access control
* Friends
* Type checking of function arguments
* Default arguments
* Inline functions
* Overloaded assignment operator
* Constructors
* Destructors
* f() same as f(void)

## C++(1985)

Features:

* Virtual functions
* Function and operator overloading
* References
* New and delete operators
* The keyword const
* Scope resolution operator
* Single-line comments

Libraries:

* complex
* string
* iostream

## C++2.0(1989 & 1990)

Features:

* Multiple inheritance
* Pointers to members
* Protected access
* Type-safe linkage
* Abstract classes
* Static and const member functions
* Class-specific new and delete
* Namespaces
* Exception handling
* Nested classes
* Templates
* New casts
* Boolean type

Libraries:

* I/O manipulators

# Standard C++

## C++98(1998)

Features:

* RTTI (dynamic_cast
* typeid)
* Covariant return types
* Cast operators
* Mutable
* Bool
* Declarations in conditions
* Template instantiations
* Member templates
* Export

Libraries:

* locales
* bitset
* valarray
* auto_ptr
* templatized string
* iostream
* complex.

STL:

* containers
* algorithms
* iterators
* function objects

## C++03(2003)

Features:

* Value initialization

# Modern C++

## C++11(2011)

Runtime Performance:

* rvalue
* constexpr
* Modification to the definition of plain old data

Build-time Performance:

* extern

Usability:

* Initializer lists
* Uniform initialization
* Type inference
* Range-based for loop
* Lambda functions and expressions
* Alternative function syntax
* Object construction improvement
* Explicit overrides and final
* Null pointer constant
* Strongly typed enumerations
* Right angle bracket
* Explicit conversion operators
* Template aliases
* Unrestricted unions

Functionality Improvements

* Variadic templates
* New string literals
* User-defined literals
* Multithreading memory model
* Thread-local storage
* Explicitly defaulted and deleted special member functions
* Type long long int
* Static assertions
* Allow sizeof to work on members of classes without an explicit object
* Control and query object alignment
* Allow garbage collected implementations
* Attributes

STL:

* Upgrades to standard library components
* Threading facilities
* Tuple types
* Hash tables
* Regular expressions
* General-purpose smart pointers
* Extensible random number facility
* Wrapper reference
* Polymorphic wrappers for function objects
* Type traits for metaprogramming
* Uniform method for computing the return type of function objects

To be continued...
