Windows Terminal is becoming popular. But there's no inbuilt support to add a shortcut to launch it directly from Windows Explorer's Folder. The below installer will add the shortcut to Folder's Context Menu, so that you can launch the Terminal and change the directory to that folder automatically.

[Download Installer][1]
{: style="font-size: 150%; text-align: center;"}

No harm if Chrome or any other browser is flagging the installer as harmful. It's because I didn't sign the installer with a Code Signing Certificate. You can trust this installer peacefully, nothing malicious inside. Check the [source code][2] instead.

This project is in Beta. [Open for issues][3].
